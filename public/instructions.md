# Digital Skills Radar - User Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the Digital Skills Radar visualisation tool! This interactive application helps you explore and understand the projected impacts and concerns around Digital Skills in Government.

## How to Use the Radar

### Navigation
- **Click on any dot** on the radar to view detailed information about that technology or skill
- **Hover over items** to see quick tooltips with basic information
- Use the **legend** to understand the different quadrants and rings

### Understanding the Radar Structure

#### Quadrants
The radar is divided into four quadrants representing different categories:
- **Techniques**: Methods and practices
- **Tools**: Software and platforms
- **Platforms**: Infrastructure and systems
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Programming languages and development frameworks

#### Rings
Each ring represents a timeline for adoption:
- **0-6m**: Immediate focus (next 6 months) - _This is either the norm or we should be looking at it now (i.e. Agile or Generative AI for productivity)_
- **6-12m**: Short-term planning (6-12 months) - _It is imminent, it is mature and standards are coming (i.e. MCP)_
- **1-2y**: Medium-term strategy (1-2 years) - _Not a new technology, nor widely embedded - you should be planning (i.e. PQC)_
- **3y+**: Long-term vision (3+ years) - _On the horizon, these items may change quickly (i.e. Natural Language engineering or pervasive use of AI across government services)_

### Special Indicators
- **Yellow "Emergent" badges**: Items marked as emerging technologies or practices that require special attention
